* Made a Deno version of GitFinger
* Implemented a good Init flow
* Started with the implementation of pushing updates
* Found bug with Deno compile that breaks prompt - no binary CLI today 😵
* Made a Deno.land repo and pushed the first version!
* Wrote a Readme.MD that I guess a lot of people have come from 🖐

## TIL

Turns out:
```
import dayjs from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/dayjs@1.10.4";
import relativeTime from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/dayjs@1.10.4/plugin/relativeTime";
dayjs.extend(relativeTime)
```
Works really well in `Deno`. Go `Deno`!!!
