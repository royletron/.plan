* Made a Deno version of GitFinger
* Implemented a good Init flow
* Started with the implementation of pushing updates
* Found bug with Deno compile that breaks prompt - no binary CLI today 😵
* Made a Deno.land repo and pushed the first version!
* Wrote a Readme.MD that I guess a lot of people have come from 🖐
